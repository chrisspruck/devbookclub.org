The Dev Book Club discusses the second chapter of Clean Code by Robert Martin. This chapter covers meaningful names. Naming is one of the challenges we face as developers and this chapter helps clarify what makes a good name and how we can appropriately name variables, functions, etc. Since code is read more often than it is written it is important to get the proper context into names. Participants in this discussion talked about some of the things they found interesting within this chapter.
