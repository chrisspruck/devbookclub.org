In this discussion, the Dev Book Club will cover Chapter 6 of Implementing Domain Driven Design: Value Objects. Our last discussion focused on Entities and identity within the domain and led to a desire to better understand the differences between entities and value objects. This discussion should prove to be useful in our quest to implement DDD practices and better object modeling in our application.
