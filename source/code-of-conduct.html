    <h2>Short Version</h2>

    <p>Dev Book Club prides itself on being a resource for developers of all walks of life. Our group is open to anyone and everyone with a passion for technology and learning, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or preference for Vim, Emacs, or any other editor. To ensure everyone has an amazing experience, we, the organizers and hosts of Dev Book Club, will not tolerate any harassment or sexually charged language directed at any participants. The organizers will deal with each observed or reported situation on a case-by-case basis and reserve the right to expel offenders from the discussion and/or the group.</p>

    <h2>Long Version</h2>

    <p>
Though each situation will be dealt with individually, this document serves as a public notice as to the criteria the organizers will use to evaluate each incident:
    </p>
    <p>
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p>
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizer or host may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the session or group.
    </p>
    <p>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Dev Book Club organization immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
We expect participants to follow these rules in all interactions with other participants of the Dev Book Club during the dicussion session and in any venue for the purposes of the club.
